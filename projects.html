    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Below are several projects I have been building to explore algorithms, game simulations, and desktop tools. Each
      project entry includes a short description and a link to the public GitHub repository where you can
      read the source, try the code, and open issues or pull requests. Tech highlights across these projects include
      Python for simulations, Qt for desktop tooling, and small utilities and scripts for data processing and testing.
      If you'd like to run any project locally, check the repo README for prerequisites and quick start steps — or
      reach out and I can help you get it running. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are very welcome!

          <h4>Pokemon Pond</h4>
          <p>a virtual ecosystem where fish and plants interact in a lively and dynamic aquatic environment.
            This project brings the ecosystem to life by modeling the behavior and survival of organisms through a 2D
            grid.
            In this world, fish swim around and consume plants to sustain themselves, while plants grow with water and
            sunlight,
            only losing mass when they’re nibbled on by the fish.<br><i>Link to Repo:</i>

          <p>This is a QT based web application that lets you build and create armys for the table top war game
            Warhammer 40k.
            Create new units or armies, see stats on units and your army as a whole, and share your army builds on the
            forms for all to see!

          <h4>Pokemon Battle Simulator</h4>
          <p>A simple text based Pokemon battle simulator. Choose your Pokemon or create enitrely new ones and battle
            against a computer opponent.
            Each Pokemon has its own unique stats and moves. This simulator includes the real damage formula used in
            the actual games. Soon to be added: GUI, type advantages, and more!<br><i>Link to Repo:</i>

          <h4>Football Simulator</h4>
          <p>This is a simple console based game that lets you make custom teams or players to create the football
            team of you dreams!
            If you want to jump straight into the action, you can use one of the premade teams and play against a
            computer opponent.
            Each player has their own unique stats that will affect how they perform on the field. This includes QB
            accuracy, WR catching, and RB speed.
            I plan on adding ways to manage your team such as trades, drafts, and a season mode!
