    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Below are several projects I have been building to explore algorithms, game simulations, and desktop tools. Each
      project entry includes a short description and a link to the public GitHub repository where you can
      read the source, try the code, and open issues or pull requests. Tech highlights across these projects include
      Python for simulations, Qt for desktop tooling, and small utilities and scripts for data processing and testing.
      If you'd like to run any project locally, check the repo README for prerequisites and quick start steps — or
      reach out and I can help you get it running. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are very welcome!

          <h4>Pokemon Pond</h4>
          <p>a virtual ecosystem where fish and plants interact in a lively and dynamic aquatic environment.
            This project brings the ecosystem to life by modeling the behavior and survival of organisms through a 2D
            grid.
            In this world, fish swim around and consume plants to sustain themselves, while plants grow with water and
            sunlight,
            only losing mass when they’re nibbled on by the fish.<br><i>Link to Repo:</i>
